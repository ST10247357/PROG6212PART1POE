# Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) – Part 1

## Overview
Welcome to Part 1 of the **Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)** project for the PROG6212 module. This project focuses on designing a **prototype** of a NET web-based application that streamlines the submission and approval of monthly claims for Independent Contractor (IC) lecturers.

At this stage, the application is a **front-end prototype**. It demonstrates the proposed GUI design, database structure, and project planning, without functional implementation.

---

## Features (Prototype)
- Lecturers can **submit claims** for hours worked.
- **Upload supporting documents** for claims.
- Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers can **view claim submissions**.
- **Claim status tracking** for transparency.
- Intuitive and user-friendly **GUI design** using MVC in NET Core.

> ⚠️ Note: This prototype is for **visualization only**. Functionality will be implemented in later parts.

## Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

### 1. Documentation
- Explanation of design choices
- Assumptions and constraints
- Layout of the GUI

### 2. UML Class Diagram
- **Lecturer**
- **Claim**
- **Document**
- **ProjectCoordinator**
- **AcademicManager**
- **ClaimApproval**
- **Invoice**
- **HR**

### 3. Project Plan

- Timeline for completing the project

### 4. GUI/UI
- Visual interface showing claim submission, approval dashboards, and document uploads.
- Designed for clarity, usability, and intuitive navigation.
